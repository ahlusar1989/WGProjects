# WGProjects

<p>There are 3 versions for Project 1 (I enjoyed experimenting with all of them). There is also a sample test case, titled, <b>unit_test</b>. For <b>spyder_Project1iterationtest.py</b>, I wrote a customized Logging module, in addition to using Python's built-in os and sys modules. This is the simplest solution. I have added comments and assumptions to each function. The other two iterations were experimentations with Python's library for Python's Linux specific pyinotify:<b> pyinotifywrite_to_a_file_log.py</b> and <b>pyinotifyWGrun.py</b>.</p>

<p>The latter two files are only for illustrating options that are available to monitor directories. For me, this was a very intellectually engaging exercise.</p> 

<p>The final commit for Project 2 is titled <b>Project_2WG-Final Version.ipynb</b>. I utilized the ipython notebook (including tests). Therefore, one will need the Chrome Extension, <b> NbViewer</b> in order to view this Jupyter Notebook</p>

<p>I have also sent the .py file for this Project that displays the functions utilized to complete this project. Corresponding to each statement and comment in this .py file, one can view the corresponding lines in the Jupyter notebook and the resulting product. All requirements were met as all unit tests passed (as one will observe when viewing the notebook).</p>
